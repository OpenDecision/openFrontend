# decisionBackend

This is a basic `RESTful web service` written with `JavaScript` (NodeJS) and `MongoDB`. Everything is set up except the config.json, which has to be modified to fit your own needs. 

The live example is running behind manage.opendecision.org.

### Install

1. `git clone git@github.com:OpenDecision/openBackend.git`
2. `cd openBackend`
3. Install all the dependencies `npm install`
5. Create a local mongoDB database and put your credentials inside the `config.json` file 
6. To run the server: `nodemon server.js`
